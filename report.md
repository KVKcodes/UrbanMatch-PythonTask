# Marriage Matchmaking App Implementation Report

## Overview
This report details the implementation of a Marriage Matchmaking App backend using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. The implementation includes all required functionality from the original task, including CRUD operations, email validation, and match-finding logic.

## Dependencies and Setup
The project uses several key Python packages:

- **FastAPI** (v0.115.6): Modern web framework for building APIs
- **SQLAlchemy** (v2.0.37): SQL toolkit and ORM
- **Pydantic** (v2.10.5): Data validation using Python type annotations
- **email-validator** (v2.2.0): For robust email validation
- **uvicorn** (v0.34.0): ASGI server implementation

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastapi sqlalchemy pydantic email-validator uvicorn
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

4. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Design
- Used SQLite for simplicity and portability
- Implemented using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Database automatically recreates on startup for testing purposes
- User model includes: id, name, age, gender, email, city, and interests

### 2. Data Validation
Implemented robust validation using Pydantic models:

#### Email Validation
- Uses `email-validator` package for comprehensive email validation
- Checks both format and deliverability
- Normalizes email addresses before storage
- Example validation:
```python
@validator('email')
def validate_email(cls, v):
    try:
        email_info = validate_email(v, check_deliverability=True)
        return email_info.normalized
    except EmailNotValidError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid email address: {str(e)}")
```

#### Other Validations
- Age: Must be between 18 and 100
- Gender: Must be either "male" or "female"
- Interests: Non-empty list with cleaned and normalized values
- Name and City: Length constraints (1-50 characters)

### 3. Matching Logic Implementation
The matching algorithm (`find_matches` endpoint) uses the following criteria:

1. Matches users of opposite gender only
2. Considers two factors for matching:
   - Common interests
   - Same city
3. Implementation details:
   - Converts comma-separated interests to sets for efficient comparison
   - Returns matches if either common interests exist or users are in the same city
   - Handles edge cases and potential errors gracefully

### 4. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for database operations
- Custom HTTP exceptions with appropriate status codes
- Transaction management with rollbacks on failures

## Testing the Implementation

### Using Dummy Data
The repository includes `dummy_data.txt` with curl commands for testing. These commands create six test users with various profiles. Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/users/" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"name": "John Smith",
"age": 28,
"gender": "male",
"email": "john@example.com",
"city": "New York",
"interests": ["sports", "music", "travel"]
}'
```


### API Endpoints
- POST `/users/`: Create new user
- GET `/users/`: List all users
- GET `/users/{user_id}`: Get specific user
- PUT `/users/{user_id}`: Update user
- DELETE `/users/{user_id}`: Delete user
- GET `/users/{user_id}/matches`: Find matches for user

## Assumptions Made

1. **Gender Binary**: The system assumes binary gender (male/female) for simplicity
2. **Interest Storage**: Interests are stored as comma-separated strings in the database
3. **Match Criteria**: A match is valid if users share either location or any interests
4. **Email Uniqueness**: Each email address must be unique in the system
5. **Database Persistence**: SQLite database is recreated on each startup (for testing)

## Future Improvements

1. Add authentication and authorization
2. Implement more sophisticated matching algorithms
3. Add profile photos and additional user attributes
4. Implement rate limiting and API security measures
5. Add pagination for large result sets

## Conclusion
This implementation provides a robust backend for a marriage matchmaking app, with comprehensive data validation, matching logic, and error handling. It can be further enhanced with additional features and optimizations as needed.
